# WheatherApp-react-native
This application is the weather forecast application that I developed for the mobile application development course. 
The api keys I use have been changed and deleted for security reasons. 
Developers need to obtain their own api keys to use the app.
The libraries I have used are: vectoricons, navigation,googleplacesautocomplate.
